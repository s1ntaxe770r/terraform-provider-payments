# terraform-provider-payments 


## What is this?

Ever wished you could make bank transfers from Terraform? Well, now you can! This provider allows you to make bank transfers from Terraform. 


## Why would you do this? 

Some say i need to be stopped , others say i need to arrested. I say, i need to be paid.


## Cool why isn't this on the terraform registry?

Because i don't want to get arrested. I can't risk someone actually trying to use this. but if you can figure out how to use it, go for it!! 


## Im not convinced, show me how it works
